        "title": "Planadaxic",
        "why": "The most computationally complex track I've produced. The aforementioned \"beeps\" alone overloaded my system. This marked the beginning of my massive instrument patch journey!",
        "startAt": 385,
        "endAt": 435
    }, {
        "title": "So Far",
        "why": "It's important to understand when it might be time to cut your losses and start over. I had considered just pushing onwards with the initial sound of the track, yet I decided that I wouldn't be as happy with the final product, which wasn't worth it.",
        "startAt": 205,
        "endAt": 252
    }, {
        "title": "Precipice of Origin",
        "why": "A calming melody with an epic chorus. Despite its simplicity, this track went through many hours of slight tweaks in order to make each instrument intertwined.",
        "startAt": 97.5,
        "endAt": 156.5
    }, {
        "title": "Momentum Deceived",
        "why": "Upon starting this track, my biggest goal was to produce realistic percussion. This is something I had attempted in the past, but in every case, I felt as though it was too complicated yet repetitive. I used BFD3's visualizations to think like a drummer, and write complex - yet not impossible patterns.",
        "startAt": 168,
        "endAt": 221
    }, {
        "title": "Order",
        "why": "As a musician, I've been learning how to play various instruments all my life. Though, one instrument I constantly pushed away was the piano. Since most of my work is synthesized through a piano roll, learning the piano could enhance my understanding of what I'm producing.",

        "endAt": 172
    }],
    "Midten": [{
        "title": "DÃ¸",
        "why": "Prior to this track, many of my songs were very repetitive. Most of them were built off of the same chorus, melody, ambience, etc. I wanted to change this, and experimented with splitting this track into different parts, and returning to the original chorus at the end.",
        "startAt": 195.15,
        "endAt": 272
    }, {
        "title": "Huil",
        "why": "It's important to branch out and try new things. This was my method of doing so. In the process, I learned a lot about both the target genre and my own personal styles. This may not be D&B, but the influence is there!",
        "startAt": 142,
        "endAt": 198.75
    }],
    "Wisp": [{
        "title": "Valley",
        "why": "Produced after Continuum, which is featured below, this track was my attempt at polishing my percussion style. I wanted to implement more parts of the drum kit into my patterns, resulting in heavy use of the toms.",
        "startAt": 122.15,
        "endAt": 156.25
    }, {
        "title": "End of Time",
        "why": "This track unknowingly paved the way for my future album, Momentum Deceived. Its retro vibe and heavy compression made their way into my personal mixing style.",
        "startAt": 210,
        "endAt": 270.5
    }, {
        "title": "Continuum",
        "why": "This was my first attempt at synthesizing percussion that could theoretically be played by a drummer. It also features one of my favorite instruments, the Mellotron!",

        "endAt": 137
    }, {
        "title": "Sanity's Culmination",
        "why": "Not only was this my first attempt at producing a proggy song, it's also the first track I wrote lyrics for. Even if cheesy, being based on events that took place in my life, they came from the heart.",
        "startAt": 335,
        "endAt": 434.5
    }, {
        "title": "Equinox",
        "why": "I just really like this track. It's likely one of my more unique tracks, featuring a very hollow mixing style. I often mix my tracks to sound very wide and full, causing this one to stick out!",

        "endAt": 169.5
    }],
    "Collection": [{
        "title": "Natural Decay",
        "why": "I still believe this track holds up to this day. I hadn't learned the art of simplicity yet, and I believed that my future tracks had to be more complex in order to prove my ability. Yet, often, the opposite is true, and this track proves it.",
        "startAt": 130,
        "endAt": 215
    }, {
        "title": "Kelno",
        "why": "While Natural Decay is the first track I publicly released, Kelno was the first track I released featuring a realistic style. I believe this song falls under the genre of contemporary, with realistic and synthetic instruments intertwined.",
        "startAt": 117.25,
        "endAt": 157.75
    }, {
        "title": "Gaze",
        "why": "While producing this track, I did not understand what I was doing. Only after it was released did I realize that I had written a song with time signature shenanigans. As someone who enjoys progressive music, this delighted me!",
        "startAt": 48.5,
        "endAt": 112
    }, {
        "title": "Grimear",
        "why": "This is the first track I made for an individual other than myself. It was also the second track I produced.",
