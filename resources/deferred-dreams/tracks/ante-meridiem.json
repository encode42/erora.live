	"description": [
		"Designed to be played as the first track of an unreleased game jam project. The jam's theme was \"folk\", which inspired me to compose something more acoustic and traditional. This was quite an unfamiliar task for me, since my prior works have consisted primarily of electronic synths and pads.",
		"",
		"The track would play at morning, while the character may still be in the process of awakening. I tried to reflect this through soft instrumentation and volatile tempo changes."
