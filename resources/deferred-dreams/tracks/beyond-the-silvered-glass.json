	"description": [
		"Inspired by chapter five of Celeste, I attempted to create a mysterious, ambient drone. This track features multiple patterns played forwards and backwards simultaneously to create a \"mirrored\" vibe. The percussion was difficult to mix, due to its booming hard-hitting nature.",
		"",
		"The track's name is based on the auditory concept showcased within; mirroring. A silvered glass is essentially a mirror, and when observed, what's beyond it is your own reflection."

	"featured": true,
	"why": [
		"From other musicians, I've often heard that I should take what I like from tracks I love, and implement them in my own way. I never understood when this would occur, or when it wouldn't be considered stealing.",
		"",
		"This track changed my mind. Before development on this track began, I had reversed the track, \"In the Mirror\" by Lena Raine. Within is another track reversed, as well as an easter egg. During this, I noticed that the percussion sounded quite interesting in reverse.",
		"Since this track has been inspired by Lena Raine's track, I decided to implement my own reversed shenanigans. I took what I liked from what I loved, and implemented it in my own way."
