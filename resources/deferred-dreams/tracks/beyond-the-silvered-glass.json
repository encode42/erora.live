		"From other musicians, I've often heard that I should take what I like from tracks I love, and implement them in my own way. I never understood when this would occur, or when it wouldn't be considered stealing.",
		"",
		"This track changed my mind. Before development on this track began, I had reversed the track, \"In the Mirror\" by Lena Raine. Within is another track reversed, as well as an easter egg. During this, I noticed that the percussion sounded quite interesting in reverse.",
		"Since this track has been inspired by Lena Raine's track, I decided to implement my own reversed shenanigans. I took what I liked from what I loved, and implemented it in my own way."
