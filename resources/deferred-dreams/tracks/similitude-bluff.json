	"description": "This track was produced with the idea of a boss battle in mind. Integrating a new motif, structure was a priority, to set a stage for future tracks in this style.",
	"featured": true,
	"why": "Weird time signatures can be cool! However, I failed the last time I tried to compose in an unusual time signature. This track changed that. I managed to program percussion that sounds real (to me), and ideally you're able to feel the \"edge\" brought on by it!",
