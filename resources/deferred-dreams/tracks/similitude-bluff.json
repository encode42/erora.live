	"description": [
		"This track was produced with the idea of a boss battle in mind. Integrating a new motif, structure was a priority. The original idea was to set a stage for future tracks in this style.",
		"",
		"To achieve a feeling of \"edge\" accustomed to boss battles, I composed in the uncommon time signature of 11/16, with bar repetition switching between two and three between the different parts of the song."

	"featured": true,
	"why": [
		"Weird time signatures can be cool! However, I failed the last time I tried to compose in an unusual time signature. This track changed that. I managed to program percussion that sounds real (to me), and ideally you're able to feel the \"edge\" brought on by it!"
