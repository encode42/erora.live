	"description": [
		"This track is meant to bring some positivity and motivation to the player. While this was produced in twenty-four hours for a game jam project that was cancelled, I'm still very happy with how this track turned out.",
		"",
		"It would play during the evening hours, meaning things would be getting intense and stressful. Capturing the feeling of tension comes naturally to me!"
