	"description": "The soundtrack for a game that's yet to exist.\n\nThis is my imagining of what I'd compose for my ideal video game! Whether this game ever makes it to release or if I'll be brought on to work on existing games is continuously unknown. Can these tracks change that?\n\nThis is essentially my resume for those interested in my work.",
