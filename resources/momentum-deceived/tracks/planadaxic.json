	"description": "This track was based on what I had created during a sound design jam session. The \"beeps\" you hear during the majority of the song were created during that session and were originally designed to be played back much faster. I tried to form a track around it but wasn't pleased with how it sounded. I had the idea to slow the whole project down, resulting in this eight-minute long epic.",
	"featured": true,
	"why": "The most computationally complex track I've produced. The aforementioned \"beeps\" alone overloaded my system. This marked the beginning of my massive homemade instrument patch journey!",
