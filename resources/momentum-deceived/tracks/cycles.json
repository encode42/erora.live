	"description": [
		"This track was my introduction to something new: music production on Bitwig Studio. I had been ready to move on from GarageBand and purchased a license after enjoying my time with Bitwig's demo. It defined the genre and sound of the album and encouraged me to improve the element of movement within my songs."
