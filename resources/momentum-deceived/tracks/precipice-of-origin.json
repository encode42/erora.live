	"description": [
		"From this album's inception, I had planned to include two transition tracks that would lead into and out of Midten, which I've now released separately. Despite this, I still liked the idea of transitioning into two halves of the album, ideally through minimalistic tracks. This resulted in such a simple yet ambient song."

	"why": [
		"A calming melody with an epic chorus. Despite its simplicity, this track went through many hours of slight tweaks in order to make each instrument intertwined."
