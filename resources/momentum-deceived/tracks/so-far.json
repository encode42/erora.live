	"description": "After I had completed Visionary, I was in the mood to create something calmer. This ended up taking an orchestral direction, which I ended up scrapping due to it not fitting in well within the rest of the album. Instead, I deleted every instrument, keeping only the notes I had placed down, and created a percussion track. This new version of the track had a similar vibe to the rest of the album, which I'm quite proud of.",
	"featured": true,
	"why": "It's important to understand when it might be time to cut your losses and start over. I had considered just pushing onwards with the initial sound of the track, yet I decided that I wouldn't be as happy with the final product, which wasn't worth it.",
