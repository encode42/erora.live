	"description": [
		"Featuring everything I've learned during this album's development, Momentum Deceived leads us into what's to come. With its realistic drum patterns powered by BFD3, this track paves the way for a less electronic album in the future."

	"featured": true,
	"why": [
		"Upon starting this track, my biggest goal was to produce realistic percussion. This is something I had attempted in the past, but in every case, I felt as though it was too complicated yet repetitive. I used BFD3's visualizations to think like a drummer, and write complex - yet not impossible patterns."
