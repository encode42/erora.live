	"description": [
		"The three tracks, \"Should we?\", All As We Know, and Prevail were developed with a video game in mind. They were designed to be simple, calm, and fit in the background of any situation. As such, they wouldn't fit on a solo album designed for sit-down listening.",
		"",
		"Recorded during the Momentum Deceived era. Produced on Bitwig Studio."
