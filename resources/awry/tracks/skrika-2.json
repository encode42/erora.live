    "description": "Featuring multiple freestyle synth pieces, this track pushed me to achieve what I have yet to accomplish. Compared to my previous tracks, Skrika contains a proper intro, a comprehensive structure with unique chorus and verse parts, and pieces that sound \"human\".\n\nRecorded during the Midten era. Produced on GarageBand for iOS."
