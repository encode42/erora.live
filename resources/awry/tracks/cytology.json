	"description": [
		"This track started with no goal in mind. What you're hearing is the result of its evolution over the course of a week. Transitions between parts are rough, as GarageBand doesn't have much in terms of transitional instruments or techniques. Biggest inspiration was DELTARUNE.",
		"",
		"Recorded during the Collection era. Produced on GarageBand for iOS."
