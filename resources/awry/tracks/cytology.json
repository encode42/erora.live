    "description": "This track started with no goal in mind. What you're hearing is the result of its evolution over the course of a week. Transitions between parts are rough, as GarageBand doesn't have much in terms of transitional instruments or techniques. Biggest inspiration was DELTARUNE.\n\nRecorded during the Collection era. Produced on GarageBand for iOS."
