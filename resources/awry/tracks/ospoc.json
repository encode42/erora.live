    "description": "This track was inspired by the OneShot OST. My goal was to compose a song that could be background music for a game. This meant keeping things simple, which was a mindset I did not have prior to this song's inception. I now realize that songs do not need to be complex and unique, as long as they serve their purpose.\n\nRecorded during the Collection era. Produced on GarageBand for iOS."
