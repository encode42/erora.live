		"This track originated from the urge to produce a track unlike anything I've made prior. Directly inspired by D&B, this track aimed to provide a \"full\" sound, with sample-type percussion and instruments.",
		"",
		"Recorded during the Midten era. Produced on GarageBand for iOS."

	"why": [
		"It's important to branch out and try new things. This was my method of doing so. In the process, I learned a lot about both the target genre and my own personal styles. This may not be D&B, but the influence is there!"
