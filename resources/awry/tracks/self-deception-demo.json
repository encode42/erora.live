	"description": [
		"I had planned for this album to imitate existing sounds rather than consist entirely of original works. This track was a result of this planning, with major inspiration from The Binding of Isaac. However, I didn't feel as though I could bring this track to completion as I'd imagined, and ended up scrapping it.",
		"",
		"Recorded during the Momentum Deceived era. Produced on Bitwig Studio."
