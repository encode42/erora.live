    "description": "This track, like the last, has also been inspired by progressive rock. It also has elements taken from electronica and normal rock.\n\nI used this track to practice composing in a 7/8 time signature, as well as experiment with some synthetic guitar sounds.\n\nRecorded during the Wisp era. Produced on Ableton Live."
