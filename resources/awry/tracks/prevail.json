    "description": "The three tracks, \"Should we?\", All As We Know, and Prevail were developed with a video game in mind. They were designed to be simple, calm, and fit in the background of any situation. As such, they wouldn't fit on a solo album designed for sit-down listening.\n\nRecorded during the Momentum Deceived era. Produced on Bitwig Studio."
