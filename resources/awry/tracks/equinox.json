    "description": "An ambient-electronic musical soundscape. Designed to easily sit in the background of anything, whether it be solo listening or a YouTube video.\n\nI do not believe I reached my goal of \"anything\", but it's a nice background listening track.\n\nRecorded during the Wisp era. Produced on GarageBand for iOS."
