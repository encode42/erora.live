	"description": "This track is very experimental, and as such may not be nice to listen to for many. Halfway through the song, the time signature starts to alternate, creating strange hangs.\n\nRecorded during the Collection era. Produced on GarageBand for iOS.",
	"featured": true,
	"why": "While producing this track, I did not understand what I was doing. Only after it was released did I realize that I had written a song with time signature shenanigans. As someone who enjoys progressive music, this delighted me!",
