	"description": "The result of a challenge to compose a song in less than an hour. This restriction let me break out of my perfectionist composition style, and rather compose a full song. I believe this turned out very well, and helped me in my future compositions.\n\nRecorded during the Collection era. Produced on GarageBand for iOS.",
	"featured": true,
	"why": "While Natural Decay is the first track I publicly released, Kelno was the first track I released featuring a realistic style. I believe this song falls under the genre of contemporary, with realistic and synthetic instruments intertwined.",
