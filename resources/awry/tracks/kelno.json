	"description": [
		"The result of a challenge to compose a song in less than an hour. This restriction let me break out of my perfectionist composition style, and rather compose a full song. I believe this turned out very well, and helped me in my future compositions.",
		"",
		"Recorded during the Collection era. Produced on GarageBand for iOS."

	"featured": true,
	"why": [
		"While Natural Decay is the first track I publicly released, Kelno was the first track I released featuring a realistic style. I believe this song falls under the genre of contemporary, with realistic and synthetic instruments intertwined."
