	"description": "Motivated by the works of Chris Christodoulou, this was my first demo focusing on producing a proggy sound. While sloppy, due to the fact that I haven't practiced guitar often, I believe this track successfully reproduces the soul of progressive rock.\n\nRecorded during the Progressive era. Produced on Bitwig Studio.",
	"featured": true,
	"why": "Though this is a rough demo that requires lots of polish, I'm proud of what I pulled off despite my limitations. Even though I didn't own a bass, nor could I think like a drummer, I still prevailed.",
