	"description": "The soundtrack for the Minecraft mod, \"Create: Estrogen\". Contains ambient music in familiar styles, as well as a secret music disc!\n\nAll of these tracks are inspired by two primary sources: Minecraft and Celeste. As the mod is for Minecraft, it was of my personal belief that I had to make songs in vain of the game's existing tracks. Additionally, the mod incorporates features from the game Celeste, so I drew massive inspiration from it as well.\n\nWhen I started producing this album, I intended to stick to the aforementioned sources as closely as possible. However, I soon realized that would not be possible with my skills. So, instead, I excuse the differences in styles for being my own personal style. I look up to Lena Raine and C418, who both have amazing and unique musical styles. I still hope that I was able to reproduce the right vibes!",
