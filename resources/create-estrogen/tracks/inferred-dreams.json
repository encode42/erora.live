	"description": [
		"Lena Raine's philosophy, with a focus on softness and quietness, took control of this track. I intentionally pushed myself to embrace the power of silence, and though I couldn't push myself as much as I'd prefer, compared to my previous tracks, I have achieved my goal.",
		"",
		"Only after I had finished this track did I realize it's subconscious inspiration: C418's remix of \"Atempause\". I loved their rendition of the track. It had been a few months since I had last heard it, so I unfortunately didn't make the connection as soon as I'd like."

	"featured": true,
	"why": [
		"Featuring randomly generated percussion and an overlapping chord pattern, this track began as my answer to Lena Raine's \"Stand Tall\". I noticed how her track mastered the concept of silence, which I wanted to reproduce.",
		"",
		"This track started with two widely spaced chords, which were then sped up and layered over the original chord pattern."
