	"description": [
		"A short and simple piano piece featuring various motifs from the tracks prior. This almost didn't make the cut due to an unexpected deadline, yet I was able to sneak it in! I'm glad, because despite its simplicity, it's a great closer for the album."

	"why": [
		"All throughout my musical journey, I have struggled to find what makes a song \"good\". Even during this album's development, I would push tracks further and further, even if it hurt the end result. This is the track I held back with. I understood that more did not equal better. I now understand that complexity and instrument count are not what make a good song."
