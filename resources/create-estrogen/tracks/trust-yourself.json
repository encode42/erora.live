	"description": [
		"My longest individual track to date. The title is inspired by the journey I personally took during production: to be confident â€” to trust myself. I had wanted to produce a ten-minute-long song since the start of Momentum Deceived's production, yet I didn't believe that I could.",
		"",
		"One would believe that longer, simple songs would be easy to make. \"There's not much there; how hard could it be?\" But it's exactly the opposite. Because of the track's simplicity, there's less to work with. Less to express yourself through. It took me hours and hundreds of revisions before I felt content with the track."
