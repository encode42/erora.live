	"description": "A track that was almost entirely produced and mastered in a single day. It doesn't exactly follow the styles of Lena Raine or C418, and was rather made as I went.\n\nDespite its extremely short production time, and the fact that it was rushed, I still enjoy the end result quite a bit! It's a unique track in the album, almost serving as a transition between my older style (as seen in G03C) and the rest of the album.",
	"featured": true,
	"why": "Shortly after this album was released, the soundtrack for Minecraft 1.21 was also announced. I struggled to make the connection between this track and any tracks from Minecraft or Celeste until the new Minecraft tracks were released. In retrospect, I believe that I've captured the vibe of the new, extraordinary track, \"Deeper\". Has Lena Raine's style already impacted my own musical styles this much, or was it an amazing coincidence?",
