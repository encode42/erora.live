	"description": [
		"As this track is designed to be played in-game through a music disc, it took on a dance vibe, which players may enjoy! It's entirely based on my own styles, with little direct influence from the prior primary sources."

	"featured": true,
	"why": [
		"Produced months prior to any other track on this album, this track helped me move on from Momentum Deceived. I didn't know where to go next, and randomly decided to contact a mod author I knew. Months later, my musical palette entirely changed."
